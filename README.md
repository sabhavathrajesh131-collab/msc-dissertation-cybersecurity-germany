# Cybersecurity Incident Response and Recovery in the German Financial Sector

This repository supports the MSc dissertation titled:

**"Cybersecurity Incident Response and Recovery in the German Financial Sector (2019–2024):  
A Mixed-Methods Analysis Using Event-Based Data and Machine Learning"**

## Overview
The project examines cybersecurity incidents affecting German financial institutions, with a specific focus on **response and recovery**, which are underexplored in existing cybersecurity research.

A mixed-methods approach is adopted:
- Event-based quantitative analysis using GDELT data
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text classification
- Machine learning model comparison (Rule-based, Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Qualitative interpretation using regulatory and institutional reports

## Dataset
The primary dataset is the **Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT v2.1)**.

Due to the large size and continuously updating nature of GDELT, the full dataset is not stored in this repository.
A representative sample dataset is provided for demonstration purposes.
