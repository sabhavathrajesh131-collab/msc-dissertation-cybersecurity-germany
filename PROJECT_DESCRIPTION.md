# Project Description

## Project Title
Cybersecurity Incident Response and Recovery in the German Financial Sector (2019–2024):  
A Mixed-Methods Analysis Using Event-Based Data and Machine Learning

## Academic Context
This repository supports an MSc dissertation submitted as part of the MSc Business Analytics programme.  
The project follows academic standards of transparency, reproducibility, and ethical data usage.

## Project Aim
The aim of this project is to analyse cybersecurity incident response and recovery practices within the German financial sector between 2019 and 2024, with a specific focus on identifying trends, resilience gaps, and alignment with regulatory expectations.

## Research Scope
- Geographic focus: Germany  
- Sector focus: Financial institutions (banking, payments, financial services)  
- Time period: 2019–2024  
- Analytical focus: Incident response and recovery phases of the cybersecurity lifecycle  

## Data Source
The primary data source is the **Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT v2.1)**, an open-access global database that aggregates media-reported events.

Due to the size and continuously updating nature of GDELT, the complete dataset is not stored in this repository.  
Instead, a representative sample dataset is provided, and the full dataset can be reproduced using the extraction logic documented in the code.

## Methodology Overview
The project adopts a **traditional mixed-methods approach**, consisting of:

1. Quantitative analysis of event-based cybersecurity data  
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text cleaning and feature extraction  
3. Event classification into Incident, Response, and Recovery stages  
4. Machine learning model comparison (Rule-based, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine)  
5. Qualitative interpretation informed by regulatory and institutional reports  

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy for data processing  
- Scikit-learn for NLP and machine learning  
- GDELT Document API for data extraction  

## Outputs
The repository includes:
- Python scripts demonstrating the analytical pipeline  
- A Jupyter notebook illustrating the workflow  
- Output tables summarising event distribution and model performance  
- Documentation supporting academic reproducibility  

## Ethical Considerations
This project uses only publicly available, open-access data.  
No personal, sensitive, or confidential information is collected or processed.  
The project complies with academic data ethics and responsible research practices.

## Intended Use
This repository is intended for:
- Academic assessment  
- Methodological transparency  
- Demonstration of analytical workflow  

It is not intended for commercial or operational cybersecurity use.
